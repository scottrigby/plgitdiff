NAME
----
plgitdiff - Shows git commit changes for plist files


SYNOPSIS
--------
*plgitdiff* [options] [<commit>] [--] [<path>...]
*plgitdiff* [options] --cached [<commit>] [--] [<path>...]
*plgitdiff* [options] <commit> <commit> [--] [<path>...]
*plgitdiff* [options] <blob> <blob>
*plgitdiff* [options] [--no-index] [--] <path> <path>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The plgitdiff(1) command shows git commit changes for plist files.

Because plist files are binary, git diff does not display the commit
differences. However, there are cases where examining this is
valuable. For example, when comparing a git-tracked, system-altered
plist config file to the last committed state.


OPTIONS
-------
plgitdiff(1) accepts all options for git diff.
